## Intro
TypeScript and JavaScript are interchangable code languages, typescript just adds *static type checking* before your code is run to ensure variable types are used correctly (will avoid code that doesn't make sense programmatically but still executes like the example below)

-- Valid JavaScript which logs Infinity ...

`console.log(4 / []);`

ALL JavaScript is valid TypeScript!

Frontend development is like building a house
HTML - Structure (like house frame)
CSS - Styling (like brickwork/decoration)
JS - Functionality (like utilities)

## JavaScript Foundations Notes

- You can run javascript directly in the web browser's console for live results/coding
- To run a js file locally, do node <your_file>.js. Use console.log() to print to terminal.
- A few ways to declare a variable (var, let, ...)
